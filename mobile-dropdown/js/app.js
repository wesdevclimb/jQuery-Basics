//problem: looks gross in small browser widths
//solution: hide text links and add better nav method

//create a select and append to #menu
//cycle over menu links
  //create an option
  //option's value is the href
  // option's text is the text of links
  //append option to select
//create button
//bind click to button
  //go to slect location
//modify css to hide link on small widths and show button and select
  //also hides select and button on larger widths
//deal with seleced option depending on current page
